          <p>
            Second Slice’s program aims to empower at-risk youth by teaching
            them valuable baking skills, providing them with an outlet for
            creativity, and offering opportunities for personal and professional
            growth. Participants will learn the fundamentals of baking,
            including pastry and cake making, while also gaining practical
            knowledge about entrepreneurship, including how to sell their
            creations for profit. Through this program, they will develop a
            sense of accomplishment, community, and self-sufficiency that
            extends beyond the kitchen.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a supportive and safe environment, our employed youth will build
            self-confidence, teamwork, and leadership skills. Ultimately, the
            program prepares youth for long-term success in their baking careers
            and personal lives.

        <h2>Logo Process</h2>
        <p>
          First started off with lots of different names, but settled with
          Second Slice, with shapes resembling a slice of cake.
        </p>
        <div class="project-image">
          <img

        </div>
        <h2>Logo Process</h2>
        <p>
          This was the initial attempt with the logo, a slice of cake shape to
          showcase the what this space is for. But the perspective and type for
          “slice” seemed a little off.

            alt="sketches of illustrtaion of the characters making a cupcake"
          />
        </div>
        <h2>Sketching Process</h2>
        <p>
          Initially, the visuals started as simple sketches of hands. However,
          after receiving feedback from peers, it became clear that creating a
          full character would be more impactful. This shift helped build a
          stronger emotional connection to the program and made the mural more
          engaging.

        </div>
        <h2>Developing Process</h2>
        <p>
          As for the logo and pattern work, it was a longer, more meticulous
          process. Choosing the right colours and positioning them thoughtfully
          took time to ensure the design felt balanced and didn’t overwhelm the
          packaging or other collateral materials.
